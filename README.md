# Generic project template
This repository contains a template of a full encompassing project that consists of software, electronics, mechanical and additional documentation. This repository is a holding place of all the templates I have scattered around and that need continual updating as I adapt my workflow.
## Structure
* [electronics](electronics/README.md) contains all the electronic hardware used in the project.
* [software](software/README.md) contains all the software used in the project. This can be embedded, PC/smartphone or test scripts, anything a computer can execute resides here.
* [mechanical](mechanical/README.md) contains all the CAD drawings, mostly 3d printable objects.
* [documentation](documentation/README.md) contains all project documentation, logs, research, papers, datasheets and more.
## Cloning
This project makes extensive use of submodules, use ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Squantor/generic_project_template.git``` to clone everything in one go.
